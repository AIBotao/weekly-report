	abstract = {Cluster analysis is used in many disciplines to group objects according to a defined measure of distance. Numerous algorithms exist, some based on the analysis of the local density of data points, and others on predefined probability distributions. Rodriguez and Laio devised a method in which the cluster centers are recognized as local density maxima that are far away from any points of higher density. The algorithm depends only on the relative densities rather than their absolute values. The authors tested the method on a series of data sets, and its performance compared favorably to that of established techniques.Science, this issue p. 1492Cluster analysis is aimed at classifying elements into categories on the basis of their similarity. Its applications range from astronomy to bioinformatics, bibliometrics, and pattern recognition. We propose an approach based on the idea that cluster centers are characterized by a higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densities. This idea forms the basis of a clustering procedure in which the number of clusters arises intuitively, outliers are automatically spotted and excluded from the analysis, and clusters are recognized regardless of their shape and of the dimensionality of the space in which they are embedded. We demonstrate the power of the algorithm on several test cases.},

abstract="Maximizing the nodes lifetime is one of the major issues in the wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Clustering algorithms represent the most well-known solution for optimizing the total consumed energy of WSNs. In clustered WSNs, each sensor is able to supervise an event and send information to its cluster head (CH) which aggregates and transmits data to the base station (BS) through other CHs in the network. This scenario causes the `hot spots' problem where closer CHs to the BS tend to die earlier because of the heavy relay data. Unequal clustering algorithms have tried to solve this problem and control the size of each cluster in the network. In this paper, we proposed a new unequal clustering algorithm called energy degree distance unequal clustering algorithm (EDDUCA) aiming to balance energy consumption and maximize the network lifetime. EDDUCA uses the `Sierpinski triangle' method in order to devide network into unequal clusters. The obtained results indicate that EDDUCA can effectively balance the energy consumption and therefore can lengthen the network lifetime.",

    abstract = { Due to the imbalance of energy consumption of nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), some local nodes die prematurely, which causes the network partitions and then shortens the lifetime of the network. The phenomenon is called “hot spot” or “energy hole” problem. For this problem, an energy-aware distributed unequal clustering protocol (EADUC) in multihop heterogeneous WSNs is proposed. Compared with the previous protocols, the cluster heads obtained by EADUC can achieve balanced energy, good distribution, and seamless coverage for all the nodes. Moreover, the complexity of time and control message is low. Simulation experiments show that EADUC can prolong the lifetime of the network significantly. }

Due to the nonuniform node distribution, the energy consumption among nodes are more imbalanced in cluster-based wireless sensor networks. Based on this problem, in this paper, a cluster-based routing protocol for wireless sensor networks with nonuniform node distribution is proposed, which includes an energy-aware clustering algorithm EADC and a cluster-based routing algorithm. EADC uses competition range to construct clusters of even sizes. At the same time, the routing algorithm increases forwarding tasks of the nodes in scarcely covered areas by forcing cluster heads to choose nodes with higher energy and fewer member nodes as their next hops, and finally, achieves load balance among cluster heads. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our protocol can balance the energy consumption among nodes and increase the network lifetime significantly."
